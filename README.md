## TODO

* add columns to already existing tables
  * UI
  * backend
* reorder cells (for default view only)
* reorder rows (maybe swap IDs in a transaction, or add an __ordering hidden field that contains it)
* create views (with SQL)
* modify table name
* export view in readonly
* related rows (always multiple; there's no point for has-one)
  * implement count on related rows for each row
